# Ultimate CRM — Implementation Roadmap

Status: **Normative delivery plan**

Parent epic: #2  
Governing rules: `SYSTEM_INVARIANTS.md`  
Delivery-control policy: `DELIVERY_GOVERNANCE.md`  
Current concise state: `PROJECT_STATUS.md`  
Detailed Phase 8 sequence: `PHASE8_DELIVERY_PLAN.md`  
Functional completeness guardrail: `CRM_CAPABILITY_COVERAGE.md`  
Business-module accounting: `MODULE_CATALOG.md`

## 1. Purpose

This roadmap defines the dependency order for a universal modular expert CRM platform. It is not a feature wishlist or a second status page.

A phase or packet is complete only when its acceptance boundary is implemented, merged and backed by the required exact-head automated or operational evidence. Universal does not mean one giant Sales module: customer identity, communications, service, catalog, pricing, commercial commitments, subscriptions, billing, consent and other independent domains retain explicit versioned ownership.

## 2. Delivery rules

1. Work is delivered as coherent reviewable packets linked to roadmap issues.
2. Every mutable aggregate has exactly one authoritative owner module.
3. State-changing behavior enters through an exact versioned capability and produces typed audit evidence.
4. Search, analytics, caches and projections remain rebuildable and non-authoritative.
5. Published contracts, policies, metadata and module versions are immutable.
6. Security, privacy, tenant isolation, compatibility and rollback are implementation requirements.
7. Business modules use governed SDK/platform boundaries and never access another module’s storage directly.
8. Exact money, time, identity, lifecycle and authorization semantics use typed contracts rather than conventions.
9. A backend packet is not production-ready while real composition, persistence or process acceptance is missing.
10. Every source or documentation change invalidates earlier exact-SHA gate evidence until applicable checks rerun.
11. Roadmap, status, phase plan, module catalog, issues and PR descriptions are synchronized under `DELIVERY_GOVERNANCE.md`.
12. No milestone may claim the universal CRM product is complete while required capability families remain unimplemented or unclassified.

## 3. Work states

The normative vocabulary is:

- Planned
- Ready
- In progress
- Gate review
- Complete
- Blocked
- Superseded

Only merged work may be represented as **Complete** in `main` documentation.

## 5. Completed platform foundation

### Phases 0.1–5 — Complete

Delivered repository governance, immutable module identity, governed Module SDK, module lifecycle, PostgreSQL tenant/RLS/record/artifact/idempotency/outbox/audit foundations and exact-version authenticated capability execution.

### Phase 6 — Complete

Delivered independent Sales `Deal` and Activities `Task` owners, versioned contracts, PostgreSQL-backed mutation/query paths, authenticated HTTP/gRPC ingress, governed event delivery, the optional Sales–Activities link, rebuildable projections and a deployable `crm-api` process.

### Phase 7 — Complete

Delivered golden module tooling, generalized projection runtime, permission-aware global search, typed web shell, immutable tenant-authorized metadata, Admin Studio publication/rollback and trusted-code UI-extension failure isolation.

### Native application-composition integrity — Complete

Issue #134 / PR #135 / merge `023fa5ef1d510d5bcc32222c739e6d58e5696fb8` established module-owned exact-coordinate routing, durable tenant activation, pre-authorization cross-owner semantics, deterministic worker contributions, exact production-route parity, immutable compatibility gates and production contribution scaffolding. It remains the required baseline for later Phase 8 modules.

## 6. Phase 8A — canonical customer master and governed customer-data lifecycle

State: **In progress**  
Parent issue: #28

Completed packets:

- **8A.1–8A.6** — customer references, Party, Account, Contact Point, Party Relationship, Customer 360, Consent and reversible Identity Resolution.
- **8A.7** — governed immutable import sources, server-side parsing/validation, resumable Party import and crash/retry recovery (#120 / PR #121).
- **8A.8** — governed Party export jobs, immutable selection/manifests, deterministic artifacts, reconciliation and both crash-window recoveries (#123 / PR #130).
- **8A.9** — Customer Data Quality Rules, Completeness and Stewardship (#124 / PR #132; merge `8a1664309be9dc0c5e3bf9014cf248b1c3680035`).

Active and planned sequence:

1. **8A.10 / #125 — Gate review:** Governed Customer Enrichment and Provenance in draft PR #137.
2. **8A.11 / #126 — Planned:** Customer Privacy Lifecycle, Restriction, Deletion and Legal Hold.
3. **Phase 8A closure:** only after both packets are merged and the full customer-master baseline is reconciled.

### Phase 8A.10 gate-review boundary

The accepted production inventory is frozen at exactly **6 public mutations + 6 permission-aware queries + 2 activation-gated worker coordinates**. Three provider/materialization coordinates remain worker-only and have no public HTTP/gRPC ingress.

The packet includes:

- immutable provider-profile, mapping, request, response receipt/conflict, suggestion, review, usage and application evidence;
- concrete exact-coordinate registry HTTP transport outside the pure module core;
- tenant-bound secret resolution, bounded network behavior, quota and circuit controls;
- independent live authorization for dispatch, response, materialization and owner application;
- deterministic replay, exact/semantic duplicate reconciliation and fail-closed conflicting provider responses;
- retain-first and terminal-reject operator resolution evidence;
- governed suggestion review and exact Party owner-capability application;
- permission-aware reads, declarative field redaction, activation shutdown and cross-tenant concealment;
- FORCE RLS, migration and fresh-PostgreSQL process evidence;
- permanent real-`crm-api` HTTP/gRPC acceptance proving successful governed persistence plus bounded authentication, tenant, visibility, Consent, activation and authorization denials;
- transaction-scoped immutable provider-profile and exact Party-version reference guards before atomic mapping/request persistence.

PR #137 may leave draft only when the final synchronized user-authored SHA passes all 17 permanent workflows unchanged and that exact SHA is recorded in both the PR and issue #125. Until merge, the packet is **Gate review**, not Complete.

Phase 8A is complete only when the customer-master baseline also covers privacy access/export/restriction/deletion/legal-hold interaction proof, tenant isolation, migrations, compatibility, process acceptance and maturity-appropriate performance.

## 7. Phase 8B — product catalog, pricing, CPQ and quote-to-revenue

State: **Planned**  
Issue: #29

Required owner domains include Product Catalog, Price Books/Pricing, CPQ, Quotes, Orders, Contracts, Subscriptions/Entitlements and governed billing/ERP/payment/tax/fulfillment integration boundaries. Catalog, pricing and commercial commitment ownership must not be absorbed into Sales.

## 8. Additional expert-product waves

After stable prerequisite domains, Phase 8 continues with:

- Sales and Activities expert expansion;
- communications and omnichannel interaction history;
- Service/Support, Knowledge and optional Field Service;
- Marketing automation, segmentation, journeys and attribution;
- Customer Success and optional Partner Relationship Management;
- projects/configurable work, documents and e-signature;
- analytics, reporting and performance management;
- workflow, approvals, human tasks and collaboration;
- responsive/mobile UX, accessibility, localization, onboarding, saved views, bulk actions, offline/retry states and critical browser E2E.

Each authoritative domain receives an explicit owner and cannot be hidden inside generic metadata or a giant Sales module.

## 9. Later platform phases

### Phase 9 — AI-native CRM

AI is an authenticated audited Actor using permission-scoped governed tools. Required outcomes include tenant/data-class/purpose/residency/cost-aware routing, permission-filtered retrieval, live authorization, approvals, budgets/failure controls and security/correctness evaluations.

### Phase 10 — signed marketplace and sandbox

Required outcomes include signed packages, publisher identity, dependency/compatibility resolution, SBOM/provenance policy, explicit grants, sandboxed untrusted execution, quotas, timeouts, kill switch and safe lifecycle operations.

### Phase 11 — enterprise security and production proof

Required outcomes include OIDC/SAML, SCIM, enterprise authorization, key hierarchy/encryption, WORM audit export, privacy/legal-hold integration, backup/PITR/restore, residency, supply-chain/security testing, load/chaos proof, SLOs, alerting, incident response and runbooks.

## 10. Immediate authoritative delivery sequence

1. Obtain one synchronized user-authored PR #137 SHA with all 17 permanent workflows successful.
2. Record the exact SHA in PR #137 and issue #125; complete review and merge Phase 8A.10.
3. Rebase and deliver #126 on the merged enrichment baseline.
4. Close Phase 8A only after the full merged customer-master acceptance baseline is proven.
5. Begin Phase 8B / #29 from the completed customer-master baseline.
6. Continue other Phase 8 waves through explicit owner-domain packets while Phase 11 hardening remains continuous.
